        /*OOP PRINCIPLES
        -Encapsulation
        -Inheritance
        -Abstraction
        -Polymorphism

        -A class defines the properties and behaviours for objects.
        -Class is a template/blueprint, where we define variable and methods
        - OOP involves programming using objects.An object represents an entity in the real world that can be
        distinctly identified.
        -For example , a student , a desk, a circle, a button, and even a loan can all be viewed as objects.An object has
        a unique identity, state and behaviour
        -As sum, objects are the instance of the class.Each object will have its own copy of variables.
        */

    /*
    -Constructor is a method that is automatically called when an object is created.
    -Constructors are used to initialize the object's instance fields.
    -They are called constructor because the help construct an object.
    - new keyword invokes the constructor of the class.
     */

      /*
      Types of Consturctors:
      No- argument Constructors:
     - A constructor that has no parameter is known as default constructor.
     - If we do not define a constructor in a class, then compiler creates default constructor (with no argument) for the class.
     - If we write a constructor with arguments or no- arguments then the compiler doesn't create a default constructor.
     - Default constructor provides the default values to object like 0, null , etc. depending on the type.!!
