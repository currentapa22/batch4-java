bundan sonra main method kullanmayacagiz bazen .Class i template gibi kullanacagiz.
java provides us create objects and classes.And create our framework UPON class & object.
Some other programming languages do this by creating a function but it is hard to manage to functions.
Creating a frameworks is good for being easy to manipulate.
By creating package ,class,object and throwing the object makes easier to manage for our framework.
OOB is based on this class.
